  ![core0_console_output](../../../../../assets/sdk/samples/mbx_core0_console_output.png)
  - for core1:
  ![core1_console_output](../../../../../assets/sdk/samples/mbx_core1_console_output.png)
  - once core1 application starts, core1 will receive messages from core0 then send them back, then in the console of core0:
